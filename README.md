This is the source code from Alexander Adelmaer's nice article 
[How to Add Two Configurable Widgets in One SwiftUI App](https://medium.com/app-makers/how-to-add-two-configurable-widgets-in-one-swiftui-app-4028bba921a5).

I made some tweaks to get it working with latest Xcode and converted the Water Reminder Widget to use AppEnum to simplify
how the frequency parameter is defined.

It should work under Xcode 26 but likely earlier versions as well.
